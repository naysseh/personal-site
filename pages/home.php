        <h1>NATASHA AYSSEH</h1>

        <p> Hi, I’m <strong>Natasha</strong>! I’m a Junior at Cornell University studying Information Science and French. </p>
        <p> As a part of the Humanities Scholars Program, I’m looking to intersect my interests in technology with my passion for the humanities and languages. I’m interested in product analysis, UX research, and UI design, and have experience with front-end development. </p>
        <p> In my free time, I run a small jewelry business called <strong>tashiitrinkets</strong> through <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/tashiitrinkets">Etsy</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tashiitrinkets/">Instagram</a>. I love to read, make playlists on Spotify, and I try to listen to a new podcast every day.</p>
        <p>Want to chat, or speak more about any of my interests and experience? Find my links on the <a href="/about-me">about</a> page or contact me at <em>nca28@cornell.edu. </em> </p>
